                The name's Jann Maldonado, a video game programmer who has a passion for video games since childhood. <br>
                This page is dedicated to blogs of the current things that I want to talk about, not only video game related topics, but also in my career as a game developer. <br>
                I also make updates on the current game projects that I'm working on to polish my game programming skills and to gain many attention to many people as possible.
