        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Blog is dedicated to post on many certain topics, video game related and my adventure as a game developer. I will post as many blog posts as I can during these times.

        <h2>Where Am I headed?</h2>
        <p>
            Right now, I don't have any plans as of yet to join the game industry. My reason is that I want to major in Computer Science because first, a game programmer needs to have the knowledge of how coding works and the fluifity of
            coding a software (eg: making a game or game engine) so that he or she can know how to properly engineer a game. Making a game with existing engines is one thing, but I think that one
            should know how game engines work so that programmers can understand how they oporate, not to mention that not every game engine is built the same. Second, many major studios like Respawn Entertainment and Imsomniac Games
            for example wants to look out for developers who have a degree in Computer Science, especially on people who have a Master Degree. Not all studios will hire people who knows how to use Unreal Engine or Unity.
