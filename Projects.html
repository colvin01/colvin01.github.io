            I'm practicing my skills with Unreal Engine 4's Blueprints since I worked a lot on C++. <br>
            Making it on Blueprints is quite easy if you compare it on making in C++ because of its visual nature. However, there are so many features that are I need to learn, just like learning many functions and syntaxes in C++.
